## Capabilities Klynt has that competitors lack

1. **Reforge nightly cycle** — 9-phase deferred synthesis no other system has.
2. **Mirror meta-cognition** — observes the agent's own behavior; foundation for self-improvement.
3. **Procedural rules** — observed → reflected → applied promotion path.
4. **Multi-CLI ingest + cross-CLI transfer** — patterns learned in one CLI propagate to others.
5. **FSRS-5 spaced repetition** — memory has a forgetting curve; review schedule trained from feedback.
6. **Skills system with progressive loading** — orchestrator layer above memory.
7. **Self-critique ring** — every extraction judged for hallucination before persisted as ground truth.
8. **Predictive cache warming** — anticipatory pre-computation of likely follow-up retrievals.
9. **Hierarchical episodic compression** — long-term memory navigable in O(log N) instead of O(N).
